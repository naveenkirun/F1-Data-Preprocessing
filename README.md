# F1-Data-Preprocessing

The purpose of this notebook is to prepare the f1 dataset spanning from 1950 to 2022, 
which is required for generating visualizations of driver performance. 
The dataset has been refined by including and excluding data from various CSV formats 
according to the visualization requirements. However, the original dataset lacks race results 
details from 2019, which I have sourced from another location to combine into a unified dataset. 
The resulting dataset includes race results information for drivers who were active as of 2022, 
spanning from 2002 to 2022.

The data preparation was done using python and it's libraries.
